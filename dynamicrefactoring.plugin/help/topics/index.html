<P>This guide will help you learn how to use the application by explaining 
the functioning of the tool with detail.

<P>You can use this plugin to define and build your own refactorings or to 
customize the ones that are already included. It is also possible to delete 
the ones that are not needed anymore. 

<P>Once you have defined a new refactoring, you will be able to run it immediately 
on Eclipse, since the list of available refactorings is populated dynamically by
the plugin.

<P>If you need to import or export refactorings you will be able to do so easily
thanks to the wizards that will help you throughout the process.</P>
<P>You can also import or export a refactoring plan.</P>

<p> The plugin allows you to categorize your refactorings, create
your own classifications and visualize the refactorings by categories in the 
catalog view. This view also implements filtering based on a refactoring's category,
name, description or keywords.
</p>

<p>On top of that the process of creating a new refactoring has become easier thanks
to a redesigned element window that shows additional information about the selected
element and provides an advanced searching mechanism.
